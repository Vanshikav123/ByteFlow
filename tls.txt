TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide secure communication over an insecure network. 
It is the successor to SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and is widely used to secure web traffic (HTTPS), email, VoIP, and many other applications.

Why TLS is Important
Encryption:
TLS encrypts data transmitted between clients and servers, ensuring that even if the data is intercepted, 
it cannot be read by unauthorized parties.

Data Integrity:
TLS uses cryptographic checksums to verify that data has not been altered during transmission. This protects against tampering.

Authentication:
During a TLS handshake, the server presents a certificate to the client. 
This certificate, which is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), helps the client verify the identity of the server,
preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

Trust:
Users feel confident knowing that their communication is secured. 
This is especially critical for sensitive transactions like online banking, e-commerce, or handling personal data.


1. Generate a Private Key and Certificate
Private Key (key.pem):
This is a secret key used to decrypt data and sign communications. It must be kept secure and private.

Certificate (cert.pem):
This file contains the public key along with information about the server (or domain) and is digitally signed by a Certificate Authority (CA) or self-signed for testing purposes.

2. PEM Format
PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail):
PEM files are Base64-encoded and typically include headers like -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- and -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----. They are the most common format for storing and sharing cryptographic keys and certificates.
3. TLS Handshake Process (Simplified)
Client Hello:
The client initiates the communication by sending a “hello” message along with the TLS versions and cipher suites it supports.

Server Hello:
The server responds with its chosen TLS version and cipher suite, and then sends its certificate (from cert.pem).

Certificate Verification:
The client verifies the certificate against a list of trusted CAs. If using a self-signed certificate, the client must trust that certificate explicitly.

Key Exchange:
Both parties perform a key exchange (using RSA, Diffie-Hellman, or another method) to generate a shared secret. The server’s private key (from key.pem) may be used here to decrypt data that the client encrypted with the public key from the certificate.

Secure Communication:
Once the handshake is complete, both the client and server use the shared secret to encrypt and decrypt messages.
